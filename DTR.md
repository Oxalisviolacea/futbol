# Futbol DTR

**Group Member Names:** Carson Jardine, Hanna Davis, Kevin David Cuadros, Shaun James  

**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):**  
We hope to gain a better understanding of how to build hashes, resolve merge conflicts in Github, work with different file types, collaborate with a large group, and finish a project.

**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):**  
- Carson is detail-oriented, organized, and can refactor code to make it readable.  
- Shaun is creative, a good mentor, and he’s an experienced developer.  
- Kevin is helpful, a good problem solver, and he has a positive attitude.  
- Hanna has experience with data analysis, practices pseudocoding, and is a thoughtful planner.  

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:**  
We all enjoy pairing so that will keep us all up to speed. It will also allow use to put our heads together and address obstacles as a group. Hanna can plan it out, Shaun can come up with creative code, Kevin can problem solve, and Carson can make it organized.  

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):**  
- We will all take Sunday (9/6) off.
- Shaun will take dinner breaks from 6:00 - 7:00, or 5:00 - 6:00 if necessary.
- Kevin will stop coding at 7:00 PM, but he’s willing to go to 9:00 if necessary.
- We will let our group members know if we need to take time off or we need a break.
*Weekdays:*
- Kevin is available from 7:00 - 9:00 AM. Carson would prefer to work in the evenings. Hanna and Shaun are open to working in the mornings.
- We will meet 10-minutes after class is over.
*Weekends:*
- We will stop coding at dinner time on the weekends and we will take Sunday evenings off.
- Shaun is available around 8 AM on Saturdays and Sundays. Hanna and Carson will start around 9 or 10 AM.
- We will take a lunch break.

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):**  
- We value open and direct communication.
- We will be flexible and make compromises.
- We will communicate in our slack group and we will use zoom or discord for pairing and planning.
- If we’re working independently or as a pair, we will make sure the group is updated on our progress.

**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**  
This project is an opportunity for us to gain more experience building hashes, a better understanding simplecov, work with mocks and stubs, and solidify basic concepts including enumerables and scope.  

**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**  
- We will share the workload.
- We will pair with all 4 group members when possible.
- Iteration 1 will be done all together.
- Iteration 2 can be divided up into 4 sections.
- Iteration 3 can be done as a group, but we will at least come together to set expectations.

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**  
- We will create a new branch for method or two.
- We will commit after passing a test.
- We will not merge our own pull requests.
- We will reach a consensus before pull requests are merged.
- Everyone will leave a comment on a pull request.
- The author will walk through the code and explain it to the group before we it’s merged.
- We will update the project board when we start or complete a task.
- We will have a debugging section on our project board.

**Pomodoro Break Schedule:** 25-minute poms  

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:** Don’t be rude, but be honest (DBAD). We will revisit the DTR on Thursday.  

**Additional Remote Considerations:** Kevin is on the east coast! Background noise.  

**Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):** See Workflow Expectations.  

**Day 1 Agenda:**   
- Complete DTR
- Setup repository
- Create project board
